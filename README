  What is wingS?
  -------------

  In a nutshell, wingS is a web application framework based on Java Servlets,
  resembling the Swing API with its MVC paradigm and event oriented design
  principles.


  Why wingS?
  ----------

  Though MVC and Swing are well established and well known, most web application
  frameworks on the market are stuck still in the paradigm of page-flow oriented
  design principles and require a heavy mixture of different technologies like
  XML, Java, etc.
  This has heavy backdrafts on the development process as it disables full reuse
  but requires to generate, write and maintain many different artifacts during the
  whole development process. Think of JSP template files, XML based page flow
  descriptions, required form beans, and so on: All of these you are required to
  write, maintain and keep in sync for every new dialog added to your project.

  In contrast wingS offers a very efficient and sophisticated way to implement
  and design complex real-world applications in pure Java, enabling to fully
  leverage modern software design principles like inheritance, component-
  oriented design, refactoring and all the others without making a stop on the
  web tier.

  Therefore wingS provides an API for designing web applications which is
  nearly identically with the well proven Java Swing API for classical
  desktop-based applications.

  This commonness with the well known Java Swing API as well as the modern event-
  and component-oriented design principles of the wingS framework enables you
  and your development team to quickly focus fully on the implementation of your
  business-critical logic by simply (re)using well known (customized) components
  instead of being bothered with web tier details throughout the whole development
  process during the software development lifecycle.

  Refer to the doc/tutorial/hellowings example for a very simple example of efficient
  and pure Java-based web application design with wingS!

  Beneath the very powerful approach of a pure Java API for web applications,
  wingS 2 has also some outstanding features to offer, like:
    o Powerful set of widgets including Trees, Tables, Menus, etc.
    o Highly flexible dynamic layout managers
    o Drag & Drop support (see WingSet)
    o Server-side code execution (AJAX / DWR)
    o Component context menus
    o Handling of browser back navigation
    o and more

  For a quick overview of these feature you may take a look on the WingSet
  demo which is contained in this distribution or can be accessed online
  on the wingS website.
